= Setting Up Your Workspace

:toc: left

== Introduction

This document provides instructions on how to set up your development workspace on both macOS and Windows. Follow the steps in the section that corresponds to your operating system.

== macOS Setup

=== Step 1: Install Golang

Go is a simple and fast programming language, developed in Google.

Download and install Golang from the official website: https://go.dev/dl/

To check installation and version (1.22.0), type:

[source, terminal]
----
go -version
----

=== Step 2: Install Go Mockery Package

To operate GoFac, you need to download Mockery Package from this website: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/vektra/mockery/v3

=== Step 3: Clone Repositories

Each repository should be cloned *development*  branch.

You can copy and paste it from the repository and type:

[source, terminal]
----
git clone -b "branch name" "Git URL"
----

== Windows Setup

=== Step 1: Install WSL

Windows Subsystem for Linux is a feature of Microsoft Windows that allows developers to run a Linux environment without the need for a separate virtual machine or dual booting.

Linux server is required to compile Go and other programming languages such as C++.

You can download it with this command in cmd/PowerShell:

[source, cmd]
----
wsl --install
----

=== Step 2: Install Golang in WSL

Run the following command in Command Prompt:

[source, cmd]
----
wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -xvf go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv go /usr/local
----

=== Step 3: Install WSL Extension in VS Code

To enhance your development experience, you can use the WSL extension in Visual Studio Code. This extension allows you to use the full power of VS Code while working within a WSL environment.

Follow these steps to install and configure the WSL extension in VS Code:

1. **Open Visual Studio Code**:
   Launch Visual Studio Code from the Start menu or by searching for it.

2. **Install the WSL Extension**:
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - In the Extensions view search bar, type `WSL` to find the `Remote - WSL` extension.
   - Click the `Install` button for the `Remote - WSL` extension by Microsoft.

   Alternatively, you can install the extension directly from the command palette:
   - Open the command palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
   - Type `Extensions: Install Extensions` and press `Enter`.
   - Search for `Remote - WSL` and select it to install.

3. **Connect to WSL**:
   - Once the extension is installed, open the command palette again (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
   - Type `Remote-WSL: New Window` and press `Enter` to open a new VS Code window connected to your WSL instance.
   - You should now be able to open and edit files within your WSL environment directly from VS Code.

4. **Verify Installation**:
   - You can verify the installation by opening a terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+``).
   - The terminal should display your WSL distribution's prompt, indicating that you're connected to your WSL environment.

=== Test GoFac
Once complete the installation, check if it is working with this command:
[source, cmd]
----
make test
----


== Conclusion

Follow the instructions for your operating system to set up your development workspace. Once completed, you'll be ready to start working on your projects efficiently.
